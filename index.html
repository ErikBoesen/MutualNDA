        <h1>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</h1>

            <!-- ERIK NAMES AND DATE NEED TO GO HERE AND AT SIGNATURE LINES AT BOTTOM -->
            
            <!-- the <strong> parts should be formatted like they're in the contract. the regular <p> tags are for plain language explanation -->

            <p><strong>THIS AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is entered into on this ____day of ___________ by and between _________________ (“Party One”) and _______________________ (“Party Two”).</strong></p>
            <p>This sentence is the start of a formal agreement or contract. It's saying that the document is officially being made on a certain day (which you fill in the blanks for) by two groups or people (also filled in the blanks). "Party One" and "Party Two" are just fancy ways of naming the people or groups involved in the agreement.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHEREAS, through this Non-Disclosure Agreement, Party One and Party Two have entered into a relationship by which Party Two may be exposed to certain confidential information of Party One, in which it has an interest in protecting.</strong></p>
            <p>This part of a legal document says that because Party One and Party Two are making an agreement not to share certain secrets (called a Non-Disclosure Agreement), Party Two might learn some private information from Party One. Party One wants to make sure that this information is kept safe and secret. For the sake of explanation, we are using “Party One” as the person who gives the information and “Party Two” as the person who receives the information. But don’t worry—with Pinky Promise, you can sign an agreement as both Party One and Party Two to keep your agreement mutual.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:</strong></p>
            <p>This part of the document says that because both parties are making promises to each other and exchanging something of value, and because they recognize that they are receiving something worthwhile from this interaction, they agree to follow the rules and conditions laid out in the agreement.</p>

            <h2>1. Definition of Confidential Information.</h2>

            <p><strong>(a)	For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any data or information that is confidential to Party One and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, in whatever medium provided, whether unmodified or modified by Party Two or its Representatives (as defined herein), whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to:</strong></p>

                    <p>The following additional secrets will be kept confidential: <span id="otherDetails"></span></p>
                </section>

            <p>This part of the agreement explains what "Confidential Information" means in the context of this agreement. It refers to any kind of information that is secret to Party One and not known by the general public. This can include different forms like data, images, or written records that Party Two receives. The examples provided clarify that this could be anything from personal details and contact information of Party One to any media like photos or videos shared by Party One. Additionally, any new information created by Party Two that uses or reflects the confidential information is also considered confidential. Party Two recognizes that this information is very important and private to Party One.</p>

            <p><strong>(b)	Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include information which: a) was lawfully possessed, as evidenced by Party Two’s records, by Party Two prior to receiving the Confidential Information from Party One; (b) becomes rightfully known by Party Two from a third-party source not under an obligation to Party One to maintain confidentiality; (c) is generally known by the public through no fault of or failure to act by Party Two inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, although the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been independently discovered by employees, consultants or agents of Party Two without violation of the terms of this Agreement, as evidenced by Party Two’s records, and without reference or access to any Confidential Information.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement specifies what does not qualify as "Confidential Information." It includes any information that Party Two already had before receiving it from Party One, as shown by Party Two's records. It also covers information that becomes known to Party Two through third parties not bound by confidentiality obligations to Party One, or information that is publicly available through no fault of Party Two (for example, if something is in the news). Additionally, it excludes information Party Two is legally compelled to disclose in legal proceedings, although certain conditions must be met before such disclosure. Lastly, it doesn't include information independently developed by Party Two without using any confidential information provided under the agreement.</p>

            <h2>2. Disclosure of Confidential Information.</h2>
            
            <p><strong>(1) From time to time, Party One may disclose Confidential Information to Party Two. Party Two will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its (i) licensed physical and mental health treatment providers, (ii) any other specific individual or entity as expressly stated by the disclosing party at the time of this Agreement, or representatives (collectively “Representatives”) who have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the current or contemplated relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement, require such Representatives to be bound by written confidentiality restrictions no less stringent than those contained herein, and assume full liability for acts or omissions by its Representatives that are inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (c) keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>(2) The disclosure limits contained in (1) are superceded by the following provisions:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>The section containing superceding provisions is now complete.</strong></p>
            <p>This part of the agreement explains how Party Two should handle any confidential information they receive from Party One. Party Two is only allowed to share the confidential information with certain people, subject to the parties’ discretion at the time of signing this Agreement. For example, a Representative could be a family member or medical professional.  These people could include directors, officers, and specific employees. Party Two must also make sure these individuals understand the confidential nature of the information and are bound by similar secrecy rules as outlined in the agreement, with Party Two being responsible for any breaches by these individuals. Additionally, Party Two must protect the confidentiality of the information with at least the same level of care that they use for their own sensitive information and cannot share it with any third parties unless specifically allowed by the agreement.</p>

            <h2>3. Use of Confidential Information.</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Party Two agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or contemplated relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Party One. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to Party Two hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in Party One. All use of Confidential Information by Party Two shall be for the benefit of Party One, and any modifications and improvements thereof by Party Two shall be the sole property of Party One.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement states that Party Two is allowed to use the confidential information they receive from Party One only for purposes directly related to their existing or planned partnership. Party Two must not use the information for any other reason without Party One’s explicit written permission. Also, Party Two does not gain any additional rights to the information, such as patents or copyrights; these remain with Party One. Furthermore, any improvements or changes that Party Two makes to the confidential information will automatically belong to Party One. Essentially, all uses of the confidential information by Party Two should benefit Party One.</p>

            <h2>4. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.</h2>

            <p><strong>Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Party Two may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that Party Two promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, Party One in writing of such demand for disclosure so that Party One, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided that Party Two will disclose only that portion of the requested Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. Party Twoagrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to the extent practicable, Party One with respect to any such request for a protective order or other relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Party One is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and Party Two is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability. Further, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability in the case that this information relates to a credible threat of severe bodily injury to the parties of this Agreement, their Representatives, or a third party.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement explains that although Party Two is generally required to keep the Confidential Information secret, there are exceptions where they might need to disclose it due to legal or regulatory requirements. If Party Two receives a legal order, subpoena, or similar directive that requires them to disclose the Confidential Information, they are allowed to do so. However, they must inform Party One about the disclosure as soon as possible, allowing Party One the chance to seek a protective order or some other legal remedy to maintain the information's confidentiality. Party Two should only disclose the specific part of the Confidential Information that is legally required, as advised by their legal counsel. They are also expected to support Party One’s efforts to protect the Confidential Information, if feasible. If Party One fails to secure a protective order, or does not seek one, and Party Two is legally compelled to disclose the information, then Party Two can do so without being liable for the disclosure. Additionally, if the disclosure of Confidential Information is necessary to prevent severe bodily harm to any involved party or their representatives, or to a third party, then Party Two may disclose such information without facing any liability.</p>

            <h2>6. Remedies.</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Both parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the value of such information. The damages to Party One that would result from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that Party One shall be entitled to injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available hereunder, whether at law or in equity. Party One shall be entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Both parties additionally agree to be bound by an alternative remedy, if one is written below.</strong></p>

                <!-- Enforcement Section -->

                <section id="fairResponseSection" class="hidden">
                    <h3>Alternative Remedy</h3>
                    <p><span id="fairResponseDisplay"></span></p>
                </section>

            <p>This section of the agreement states that both parties recognize that the confidential information being shared is extremely valuable and unique. If this information were to be released without authorization, it would significantly reduce its value or usefulness. Since it would be very difficult to determine the exact financial damage from breaking the agreement, the agreement specifies that Party One can seek immediate legal action (injunctive relief) to prevent any further sharing of this confidential information. This legal action is meant to stop secret sharing from continuing, in addition to any other legal remedies that might be available–whether they involve suing for damages or other court actions. Moreover, if Party One has to take legal action to enforce this agreement or to stop unauthorized sharing of the information, they are entitled to have their legal costs and attorney fees paid by the other party involved in the breach. Additionally, in any lawsuit related to this agreement, the winning party can recover its attorneys' fees and other costs related to the lawsuit.</p>

            <h2>7. Return of Confidential Information.</h2>

            <p><strong>Party Two shall immediately return and redeliver to Party One all tangible material embodying any Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals, records, excerpts or derivative information deriving therefrom, and all other documents or materials (“Notes”) (and all copies of any of the foregoing, including “copies” that have been converted to computerized media in the form of image, data, word processing, or other types of files either manually or by image capture) based on or including any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval, upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as Party One may so request; provided however that Party Two may retain such of its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its reasonable document retention policies. Alternatively, Party Two, with the written consent of Party One may (or in the case of Notes, at Party Two’s option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (or the reasonably nonrecoverable data erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such destruction by an authorized officer of Party Two supervising the destruction).</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement states that Party Two must return all materials that contain confidential information provided by Party One when their dealings end, the agreement itself ends, or whenever Party One requests it. These materials include not just physical items but also notes, texts, photos and videos, and any other physical or digital archives that place Party One’s information at risk. However, Party Two is allowed to keep some documents if they are necessary to comply with its standard document retention policies. If it’s preferable, Party Two can also choose to completely destroy the confidential materials instead of returning them, provided they do so under supervision and can offer written proof of this destruction from an authorized officer. This option also requires Party One's written approval if it involves materials that Party One might still consider sensitive.</p>

            <h2>8. Notice of Breach.</h2>

            <p><strong>Party Two shall notify Party One immediately upon discovery of, or suspicion of, (1) any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by Party Two or its Representatives; or (2) any actions by Party Two or its Representatives inconsistent with their respective obligations under this Agreement, Party Two shall cooperate with any and all efforts of Party One to help Party One regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement means that if Party Two either uses the confidential information wrongly or suspects that this might be happening, they must immediately tell Party One about it. Additionally, if Party Two does something that goes against their obligations under the agreement, they must also inform Party One right away. In such cases, Party Two is required to help Party One in any efforts to get back the confidential information and to stop any more unauthorized use of it.</p>

            <h2>9. No Binding Agreement for Transaction.</h2>

            <p><strong>If the Confidential Information specified in this Agreement concerns information relating to a business deal between the parties, then the parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement means that just by signing this agreement, neither party is obligated to go through with a business deal (referred to as a Transaction). This section is only relevant in the context of a business deal involving the parties, which could include something like a private sale of a used vehicle between friends, for example. Each party has the right to back out of proposals, stop discussions, or end negotiations at any time according to their own choice. The agreement also clarifies that it doesn't create a business partnership or joint venture between the parties. If a deal does proceed, any non-disclosure or secrecy terms in the deal-specific documents will take precedence over this agreement. However, if those deal-specific documents don't include non-disclosure terms, then the terms of this agreement will apply.</p>

            <h2>10. Warranty.</h2>

            <p><strong>NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER. The parties acknowledge that although they shall each endeavor to include in the Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for the purpose of the evaluation of a Transaction, the parties understand that no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information is being made by Party One. Further, neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information it chooses not to disclose. Party One shall have no liability to Party Two (or any other person or entity) resulting from the use of Party One’s Confidential Information or any reliance on the accuracy or completeness thereof.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement states that neither party is making any guarantees about the information they share under this agreement. While both parties will try to share information they believe is important for evaluating a potential business deal, there is no promise that this information is accurate or complete. Additionally, neither party is required to disclose any specific piece of information if they choose not to. Therefore, if Party Two uses the information shared by Party One and encounters any issues because the information is inaccurate or incomplete, Party One cannot be held responsible or liable for those issues.</p>

            <h2>11. Miscellaneous.</h2>
            <p><strong>(a)	This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification is sought.</strong>></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement states that this document is the full and final agreement between the parties regarding the issues covered in it. It replaces any previous agreements or discussions they might have had about this topic, whether those were spoken or written. Additionally, any changes to this agreement must be made in writing and signed by the party who would be affected by the change.</p>
            
            <!-- ERIK ERIK ERIK THE STATE THEY'RE IN NEEDS TO GO HERE -->

            <p><strong>(b)	The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of _____________________ (state) applicable to contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts located in _______________ (state) shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under, or in any way connected with or related to, the terms of this Agreement and Party Two: (i) consents to personal jurisdiction therein; and (ii) waives the right to raise forum non conveniens or any similar objection.</strong></p>
            <p>This part of the agreement specifies that the laws of a particular state will govern how this agreement is interpreted and enforced. It states that any legal actions or disputes related to this agreement must be handled in the federal or state courts of that same state. Party Two agrees to accept that these courts have the right to judge the case and also agrees not to object to having the case heard in these courts based on the location being inconvenient.</p>

            <p><strong>(c)	Any failure by either party to enforce the other party’s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.</strong></p>
            <p>This part of the agreement means that if one party does not strictly enforce any part of the agreement at one time, it doesn't mean they give up their right to enforce that same part or any other part of the agreement in the future.</p>
            
            <p><strong>(d)	Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it enforceable.  If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.</strong></p>
            <p>This part of the agreement suggests that if a court finds any of the rules designed to protect confidential information too strict to enforce, the specific rule will be changed or reinterpreted to make it enforceable. If it can’t be modified to be enforceable, it will be excluded from the agreement, but the rest of the agreement will still be valid and enforced without it.</p>

            <p><strong>(e)	Any notices or communications required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other party first indicated above (or such other addressee as may be furnished by a party in accordance with this paragraph). All such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and (c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement explains how either party can officially communicate with the other using different methods: hand-delivery, overnight carrier service, email, or certified mail. It specifies where these communications should be sent (the address first listed or a new one provided later). It also details when each type of communication is considered officially received: on the same day for hand-delivery or email, three business days after sending by overnight carrier, and seven business days after sending by certified mail.</p>

            <p><strong>(f)	This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither party may directly or indirectly assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, assigns and designees.</strong></p>
            <p>This section of the agreement means that the contract is specific to the parties who signed it, and it cannot be transferred to someone else without written permission from the other party involved. Despite this, the obligations outlined in the agreement will still apply to any successors or new parties that take over responsibilities from the original parties.</p>

            <p><strong>(g)	Paragraph headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not be used or relied upon in the interpretation of this Agreement.</strong></p>
            <p>This section states that the headings of paragraphs in the agreement are just for easy reference and should not be used to interpret the meaning or intent of the clauses in the agreement.</p>

            <p><strong>(h) 	No provision in this Agreement shall be interpreted to subject Pinky Promise, LLC. to liability for any dispute arising from this Agreement.</strong></p>
            <p>This section means that nothing in the agreement should be understood as making Pinky Promise responsible for any legal disputes that come from this agreement.</p>

            <p><strong>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.</strong></p>
            <p>This phrase means that the parties have signed this agreement on the date mentioned at the beginning of the document to officially acknowledge and agree to its terms.</p>
